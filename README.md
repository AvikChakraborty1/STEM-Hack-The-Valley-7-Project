# Overview
STEM was inspired by our group members, who all experienced failure of a personal health goal. We believed that setting similar goals with our friends and seeing their process will indeed inspire us to work harder towards completing our goal. We also agreed that this may encourage us to start challenges that we see our friends partaking in, which can help us develop healthy lifestyle habits.

# What it STEM
STEM provides a space where users can set their health goals in the form of challenges and visualize their progress in the form of a growing tree. Additionally, users can see others' progress within the same challenges to further motivate them. User's can help promote fitness and health by creating their own challenges and inviting their friends, family, and colleagues.

# How we built it
This mobile application was built with React Native, Expo CLI, and Firebase.

# Challenges we ran into
One challenge that we ran into was the time limit. There was a few parts of our project that we designed on Figma and intended to code, but we were unable to do so. Furthermore, each of our group members had no prior experience using react-native which in combination with the time limit, lead to some planned features being undeveloped. Another challenge faced was the fact that our project is a very simple idea with a lot of competition. We

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Aesthetics and UI Being able to learn React Native and use it to build a project in 36 hours. Having a creative visual for progress An idea with a business potential

# What we learned
How to be more consistent with version control to work better as a team How to build an effective NoSQL database schema

# What's next for STEM
Adding a live feed page that allows you to see, like, and comment on friend's posts when they post about their progress in a challenge. Partnering with companies to create incentives for certain achievements. (E.g. getting a discount on certain sportswear brands after completing a physical challenge or certain tree level)
